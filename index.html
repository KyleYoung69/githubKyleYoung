			Section One: What I know and what I want to know
		</h3>
		<p>
			I’ve always been interested in technology ever since I was a kid. Computers and video games were always my favorite activity. I’d go to school thinking about what I was going to do in my favorite games when I got home, and I’d spend hours and hours exploring virtual worlds. Something that I had never really put much thought into when I was a kid was the idea that my entire world could be technology with the use of virtual reality. Back then, the hardware could not handle the idea of VR (Virtual Reality) without the use of shortcuts that overall made the experience not worth investing into and made it look like a pipedream, something only fantasized in movies like the matrix and spy kids 3D. Virtual reality was a failure in the video game market 10 years ago. But the year is 2020, and virtual reality is more mainstream than ever. Companies like Facebook, HTC, and Valve are putting their resources into virtual reality because the technology has evolved. I own a virtual reality headset, a PSVR, for the Playstation 4, and I often enjoy using it. It’s great for putting in a living room and having people over to try games like beatsaber and superhot, but thats all I use it for. The technology of Virtual Reality has been pushed so much farther than just my uses of it, and I really like the idea of a second world to explore just by putting on a headset. But a world without productivity is an incredibly boring and sad world, and my question is can I sustain myself, and be productive in a full time virtual world? My knowledge of virtual reality is limited, but how the tech works is basically they put a screen in front of my face in the headset, and use cameras, lights and infrared technology to track my movements as accurately as they can. But my questions on this topic come from prolonged use of virtual reality. Part of sustaining myself is feeding myself. How can I stay relatively healthy while not having any access to the outside world. How can I bathe and keep myself clean, while still being in the virtual world? How can I stay in shape while not taking a step outside of my room? Part of being productive is creating relationships, and is doing that over the internet when I have never seen the person fully emote because of the limitations of the technology of virtual reality possible? How can I learn and go to a college class and sustain a job while always in the computer? Something to consider is what are the drawbacks of being in virtual reality for an incredibly prolonged amount of time. How would that affect my eyes, and more importantly, my brain? Every new form of technology will be used and abused by a third party for mal-intent, it has happened for everything. How can people take advantage of me though the technology of Virtual Reality?

			Section Two: Research 
		</h3>
		<p>
			When I went into the research there were lots of red flags about my prospects of a virtual world. The social stigma of giving up your life and living in a virtual world is very prevalent especially in the eyes of some computer developers. Their idea is that the “tech wasn’t created to support that type of usage” (Faliszek) and that since that is the case, it would provide more hurt than help. My answer is that I’m not looking if it’s good for me, I only care if I can do it. My first question was about how long I could be in VR without getting sick. I found that it varies from person to person. I also found other side effects from using VR for an extended period of time like dizziness, disorientation, eye soreness and loss of spatial awareness (Business Insider). I found that a study from the University of Queensland shows that most people that do spend a prolonged amount of time with very large neck movements in virtual reality do experience simulator sickness, but the severity of the effect is low (Trelevean 275). Virtual reality and simulator sickness also do not affect cognitive performance (Mittelstaedt) . Although spatial awareness is a big issue, I think it's the one thing that could probably get fixed. I then found a guide one how you can map your entire room in VR in under an hour, so that could help with spatial awareness (YVR). Keeping yourself healthy physically is actually very easy. VR games are focused on two things being emmersment and motion and those two factors can really help me work out and probably even lose weight. 
			Without much conclusion to the answer, I moved on to the next question, how can you create relationships and do work in VR? It seems like through VR it is incredibly easy to make relationships. It is easy to find the people that you would want to be around. Over the course of using online virtual reality servers to link up with other VR users, I can find people all over the globe to talk and share thoughts.  I believe that this is more effective than a general chat room because of the use of being able to actually see a representation of the person that is on the other side of the globe. Currently, VR can express emotion in conversation with the use of general body movements and in the future facial capture will be used to express emotions into virtual reality (UploadVR). Virtual reality is also a way to constantly meet new people, since there are more people on virtual reality chat rooms as ever. So to test my theory I decided to go into an application called VRChat and make some friends. I set my avatar to a hot dog and made my way into the virtual world. When I went into the first virtual chat room which was a bar with the name “the pug” I went and sat down at the bar near some people talking. I joined their conversation about Pokemon and something immediately came to me on how virtual reality can help in comparison to a normal chat room, which was eye contact. It’s much easier to speak to someone who is actually acnologing you and although they aren't looking at you, they are maintaining eye contact with the avatar that represents you.
			After I got my results from the test of making a friend, I decided to tackle the last question on my mind which was can you sustain a job while entirely in VR. I found an article in The Guardian about spending an entire productive work day in only Virtual Reality. He uses apps that emulate a web browser in a virtual reality space. Essentially, it's like normal desk work, but in a different simulated space. Overall, he seemed to have a negative experience, stating that the tech for swapping apps conveniently in VR is not ready yet, and low resolution   on VR screens made things difficult from viewing from far away, but he stated some upsides of working in VR. This benefit was that he was more concentrated on his work. Being in a space where there are no immediate distractions for work is helpful for getting efficient work done.
			After I found that out,  I wondered to myself, has there been anyone that has actually done this before? So I searched on google and found a youtube video by a channel called Disrupt about a guy who spent a week in a virtual headset. This video was incredibly cool, and showed what he did from day to day in his week, while also keeping the Virtual Reality talk relevant, and showing the physical and mental effects of prolonged VR usage. Something he mentioned in the video that I found interesting was about the concept of time in VR. “Time at this point feels like a concept, only a number.”, which would mess up sleep schedules, and lose track of time. I looked in the description and found that the guy, Jak, who made the video’s direct messages on Twitter were open, so I sent him a message asking for an interview, and he said yes. Our interview went fast, as I just asked him some questions and he gave me some answers, and here's what I learned. He had no problem living in the virtual world stating he had no signs of eye pain or disorientation, and only. He described having  ‘Light nausea during high intensity/flying experiences “, but no nausea occurring from prolonged use. He cooked by using “pass-thru VR” which essentially let you see your surroundings while in the headset. I wasn't sure if this counts as cheating or not, but it's still in the headset, so it's still in vr. He made a do it yourself cover so he can take a shower but keep the headset from damage. He described how he worked on his other videos for his channel, while in VR. I asked him about making relationships and he said that he “personally feel(s) more comfortable communicating over VR than in real life”. I then asked about possible toxicity in virtual online communities, which he said there was a low amount during his stay in the VR, “depend(ing) on who you hang out with or what places in the metaverse and individual goes”.

		<h3>
			Section Three: What I Concluded and How this Search Matters
		</h3>

		<p>
			When I came into this search I really didn’t know what to expect. I wanted to learn what the limitations of a currently developing technology was, and so see if one could escape into fantasy using it. Based on this search I found that it is possible to live in virtual reality. It is entirely possible to be able to sustain yourself, your relationships, and your work all in the headset. It is definitely not easy, and definitely not recommended, you can do it. Some things like the ability to make relationships with people have increased <strike>a</strike>effect from just meeting someone in a chat room, or even just off the street. Being able to sustain yourself, physically and mentally is possible, but there are some effects that come with such prolonged use of under developed technology. in the video by Jak, he states that “VR is whatever you want it  to be”, and I think that's great. Virtual reality can be another life. With the ability to decide to leave the outside world for a virtual one, one that they can make to their liking, is an incredibly cool thing that shows how far we have come as a species and how far technology has come. The power virtual reality brings us is so immense and can be used to live a lifetime. I used to think that you might call someone like that a shut-in, but if they are living their best life in the headset, why does that matter to me? If there is an alternative, because some people need an alternative, why not give them that? Virtual reality can be a hobby to some, but to others it's everything, because virtual reality is whatever you want it to be. 
			This search matters because it shows how far we can go with technology. It seems like we have gone so far with technology in the first place. I truly can not imagine living in a world without interesting technology like this. In the future, technology will be stronger than it has ever been before, and there's no way to stop that kind of innovation. Some people dread a future with virtual reality, because they are paranoid of innovations to that extreme, but I love the prospects of a technologically fueled future, even if it's not the same thing I’m experiencing currently. The experiences that you can make with technology is just going to keep expanding over the course of time, and it excites me. There are only going to be new ways that we can express art and emotion, through the power that virtual reality gives us. It makes me want to learn how technology is created and how Virtual Reality can be improved and expanded so that it can be the best it can be. I think the idea of working in virtual reality would be incredibly cool to me, and I would like to do so in the future. This project has inspired me to look into the future, and if I wanted to, I could make my reality much more virtual.

		Addendum
	</h1>
	</p>
		I created a section and pasted my paper in it. I created headers for the respective sections going in order. i corrected a typo using a strike tag. I then created another section for the works cited. i created an unordered list and list indexes. I created the youtube video on my page by embedding it, using youtubes code. I typed out the works cited, then hreffed (no clue on correct terminology) the link. I launched a local host and was able to access my file. I realized my headers were getting smaller and smaller, so i made them all the same number so they would be the same size.  the video was in line with the text, so i changed that using br, and i also alligned my paper header by using br. I gave the works cited header a u. the links didnt work at all. I changed it so that the text was inside where it belongs, so that it worked. some links didnt work, realized that they needed http:// before or it will always take you to a directory in website folder.
